Title: An R package to simulate DNA methylation data

Description: methsim is software to simulate DNA methylation sequencing data.
    methsim can currently simulate data from bisulfite-sequencing assays such as
    methylC-seq or BS-seq. It uses a non-stationary, inhomogeneous Markov model.
    This model can incorporate the strong spatial dependence of DNA methylation.
    Simulation parameters can be estimated from data or specified by the user.
