\title{Simulate DNA methylation data.}
\description{
\pkg{methsim} is software to simulate DNA methylation sequencing data.
\code{methsim} can currently simulate data from bisulfite-sequencing assays,
such as methylC-seq or BS-seq. It uses a non-stationary, inhomogeneous Markov
model. This model can incorporate the strong spatial dependence of DNA
methylation. Simulation parameters can be estimated from data or specified
by the user.
